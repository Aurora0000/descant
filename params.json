You'll need to configure nginx to serve up static files. [This](https://gist.github.com/Aurora0000/0af65d3310e2c7d059fb) code may be helpful.\r\n\r\n## Developing with Descant\r\nIf you're interested in developing the front-end of Descant, take a look in static/descant/. Otherwise, you'll find the descant/ and forums/ directories interesting.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
